# Porn-Hole

Porn Hole is just an image slide show, intended to be displayed at large or small group gatherings where that might be appropriate.

We used to use TumbView for it. Then Tumblr nixed adult content.

I went looking for a desktop app with 4 simple criteria:
  1) Let me specify a directory (or tree) as a source for the images to display
  2) Let me display them in randomized order
  3) Let me set an interval for how often to rotate through them
  4) Let me view them at full screen (generally to be cast to a TV)

You'd think that would be very basic and there'd be at least half a dozen options to choose from...

Turns out you can really only find things that cover some combination of 2 of those 4. I think I found one that did 3 of them.

So...I wrote one.

Just so I can have a reliable slideshow of porn.

Or not porn, as appropriate.

But really just porn.

I am fully aware that--on top of being completely amateur in design--there are a number of coding atrocities herein.
I am a back-end programmer. I work with micro-services and data. I know just enough about front-end coding to get myself into
trouble. As you can see.

I apologize for nothing. This does what I need it to do. If you wanna do it up right, be my guest.

Anyway, this is v1.1, which addressed some things beyond those initial 4 requirements.

* An assortment of fatal bug fixes.
* Opens the full screen view on the same screen as the controller.
* Added some manual forward and back navigation.

A future nice-to-have would be the ability to share the current image to email/Twitter/Telegram/whatever. Dunno if I'll ever
get to that. But there you go.
